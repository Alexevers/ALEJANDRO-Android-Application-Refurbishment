# Android Application Refurbishment
This is a Google Summer of Code 2022 project. 

Liquid Galaxy LAB has been participating in Google Summer of Code for 12 years,
and during all these years, there have been many contributors who have developed applications to be used in a Liquid Galaxy.
However, some of these applications havenâ€™t been released to the Play Store or App Gallery.
The project's purpose is to update and upload these apps.

Here there are app sections with info:

This project consist of a remote controller for Liquid Galaxy. With this controller the user will be able to interact with Liquid Galaxy in a more dynamic way, using a remote control that can be connected to Liquid Galaxy using a USB cable or just connecting to the same internet network via WiFi. This project has two different controllers.

This project also has an Android application that should be used to personalize navigation with the developed controllers. This application has a friendly and intuitive interface, with simple commands and connections for sending data to the controllers. Using this application the user will be able to:

- Change the default navigation list of controls;
- Create personalized navigation lists with your favorite places;
- Change the tour time during the tour;
- Start the connection to the WiFi network between the controls and the Liquid Galaxy and update the network data, if necessary;
- Learn a little more about GSoC, the Liquid Galaxy community and the whole project and its collaborators on the information page.
