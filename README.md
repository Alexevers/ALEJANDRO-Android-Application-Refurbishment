# Android Application Refurbishment
This is a Google Summer of Code 2022 project. 

Liquid Galaxy LAB has been participating in Google Summer of Code for 12 years,
and during all these years, there have been many contributors who have developed applications to be used in a Liquid Galaxy.
However, some of these applications havenâ€™t been released to the Play Store or App Gallery.
The project's purpose is to update and upload these apps.

Here there are app sections with info:

## Image Satellite Visualizer

</div>
Liquid Galaxy as a meaningful presentation tool has a lot of information that can be displayed for diverse purposes like an educational tool, or for a monitoring system. 
This app shows the real time visualization of satellite images that are attached as layers of google earth, besides being able to have diverse information about the earth being graphically generated as storms, fires, masses of heat and water vapor, a synchronous earth visualization  allows for more complex interactions.
