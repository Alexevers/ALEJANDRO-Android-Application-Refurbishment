# Android Application Refurbishment
This is a Google Summer of Code 2022 project. 

Liquid Galaxy LAB has been participating in Google Summer of Code for 12 years,
and during all these years, there have been many contributors who have developed applications to be used in a Liquid Galaxy.
However, some of these applications havenâ€™t been released to the Play Store or App Gallery.
The project's purpose is to update and upload these apps.

The Reforestation Assistant & Simulator idea is to create an app to help on reforestation of degraded areas of the planet by drone or manually. The project consist of an Android App where users can plan the reforesting missions, by defining areas of seeding, specific seed/tree location, drone landing points, fly zones and other helpful metrics. All the gathered information can be dynamically displayed on a Liquid Galaxy using KMLs and also on the app with the help of graphics and text to bring users a great and immersive overview of the mission panorama.
